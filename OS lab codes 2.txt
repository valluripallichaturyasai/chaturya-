echo "All even-numbered lines deleted from $input_file."

25)Write a script called hello which outputs the following: • your username • the time and date • who
is logged on • also output a line of asterices (*********) after each section.

current_datetime=$(date)

# Get the list of users currently logged in
logged_in_users=$(who)

# Output the username
